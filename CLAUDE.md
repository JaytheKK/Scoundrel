# Scoundrel — Project Notes

A browser-based implementation of **Scoundrel**, the single-player dungeon-crawler
card game by Zach Gage & Kurt Bieg, built with plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript
(no framework, no build step — just open `index.html`).

## Game Rules (reference for implementation)

- **Deck (44 cards):** a standard 52-card deck with the jokers removed, plus
  all red face cards (J, Q, K of Hearts and Diamonds) and both red Aces removed.
- **Suits / roles:**
  - **Clubs & Spades** → Monsters. Value = attack strength
    (2–10 face value, J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14).
  - **Diamonds** → Weapons (value 2–10, higher = stronger).
  - **Hearts** → Health Potions (value 2–10, higher = more healing).
- **Health:** player starts at 20 HP, max 20 HP.
- **Rooms:** 4 cards are dealt face-up as a "room". The player resolves 3 of
  the 4 cards (in any order); the 4th card is left and carried over into the
  next room (which is then filled back up to 4 new cards).
- **Fleeing a room:** the player may avoid an entire room once, but not two
  times in a row. Fleeing puts the whole room back at the bottom of the deck.
- **Fighting monsters:**
  - Barehanded: take full damage equal to the monster's value.
  - With an equipped weapon: damage = monster value − weapon value
    (minimum 0). The weapon can only be used on a monster whose value is
    **lower than the last monster it defeated** — once used on a "too strong"
    monster, further use degrades/limits it. Equipping a new weapon discards
    the old one (and any monster stacked on it).
- **Potions:** drinking a potion heals HP up to the max of 20. Only the
  **first** potion consumed in a given room actually heals — any additional
  potion in the same room has no effect (still must be resolved/discarded).
- **Win condition:** clear all 44 cards from the dungeon.
- **Lose condition:** HP drops to 0 or below.

## Conventions

- Plain **vanilla JavaScript**, no frameworks, no npm build step.
- Files:
  - `index.html` — page structure
  - `style.css` — styling
  - `game.js` — game logic + rendering
- Keep game **logic** (deck, rooms, combat rules) separate from **DOM/rendering**
  code as much as practical, so logic can be tested/reasoned about on its own.
- Everything user-facing (card names, buttons, messages) is in **English**.
- Build incrementally: deck/shuffle → room mechanic → combat/weapon/potion
  logic → win/lose conditions → UI polish. Verify each step before moving on.
